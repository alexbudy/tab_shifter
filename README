Chrome extension for tab shifting

Found on the Chrome Store [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hmmkcfoallifpmilkijjikcbcnnbcbih?hl=en-US)

Ctrl+Left/Right = Moves active tab left/right one position
Ctrl+Up = Pins/unpins active tab

Setting allows for disabling whilst in a text edit box, as this can interfere with writing
